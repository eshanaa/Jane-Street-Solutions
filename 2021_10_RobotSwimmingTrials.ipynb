In the Robot Swimming Trials, 3<em>N</em> identical robots compete for <em>N</em> equivalent spots in the finals by swimming <em>N</em> races. Each robot precommits to spending a certain amount of its fuel in each race. After all the races are run, the spots in the finals are given to the winners of the races, moving from the fastest winner to the slowest. (Once a robot wins a race, it is ineligible to win another race.) A robot’s speed is strictly increasing in the amount of fuel it spends, and ties are broken by randomly choosing the winner among the robots that have spent the same amount of fuel.</p>\n",
       "<p>Mathematically speaking, the 3<em>N</em> robots each submit a strategy, which is an <em>N</em>-tuple of nonnegative real number “bids” summing to 1, representing the fuel burned in each of the <em>N</em> races. The winners of the races are then determined from the highest bid (across all races and all robots) on down, with ties broken randomly. Once a robot wins a race their other bids are deleted, so we are guaranteed to get <em>N</em> distinct qualifiers for the finals.</p>\n",
