      "Tangled! While on vacation in Terniquaternaria, Decimus got to experience the country’s traditional folkloric dance, which they call the “ Yawn-ock “. The people of Terniquaternaria pride themselves on being rational , so they dance the Yawn-ock by the following strict rules. Four dancers hold one end of two long pieces of rope and never let go. They initially take the following positions:\n",
      "\n",
      "During the entire dance, only two types of move are allowed: The entire group rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise (ie the dancer in A moves to B, dancer in B moves to C, etc). This step is called a “Rotate” (R). Dancers in C and D swap places, with D holding the rope up while C is passing under. This step is called a “Swap” (S). From the initial configuration, a dance master calls out successive R/S steps randomly, that the dancers diligently execute accompanied by music. After this, there is usually quite a tangled mess of rope in the middle! A participant from the crowd can then step forward and attempt to untangle the ropes by shouting a sequence of the same two moves as above, that the dancers execute. If this person succeeds in fully untangling the ropes, he/she gets crowned King/Queen for the day!\n",
